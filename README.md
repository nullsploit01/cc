## Challenges

### 1. Word Count Utility (wc)

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-wc](https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-wc)
- **Challenge**: [wc Challenge on CodingChallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc)
- **Description**:  
  The Word Count Utility (wc) is a custom implementation of the classic Unix `wc` command. This utility counts the bytes, words, lines, and characters in a given text file or standard input. It supports input from both files and standard input through piping.

### 2. JSON Parser

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-json-parser](https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-json-parser)
- **Challenge**: [JSON Parser Challenge on CodingChallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json)
- **Description**:  
  This project is a custom JSON parser designed to validate JSON files for syntax and structural correctness. The parser also runs predefined tests on JSON datasets to ensure that the files conform to expectations.

### 3. Compression Tool (cccmp)

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-compressor](https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-compressor)
- **Challenge**: [Huffman Compression Challenge on CodingChallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman/)
- **Description**:  
  CCCMP is a custom implementation of a compression and decompression tool based on Huffman coding. The tool is designed to efficiently compress and decompress files up to 100MB in size, featuring a command-line interface for easy operation.

### 4. Load Balancer (cc-load-balancer)

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-load-balancer](https://github.com/nullsploit01/cc-load-balancer)
- **Challenge**: [Load Balancer Challenge on CodingChallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-load-balancer)
- **Description**:  
  This project is a custom implementation of a load balancer that efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across a number of backend servers. It checks the health of backend servers, balances the load based on their real-time status, and ensures high availability and reliability of the hosted applications. The implementation leverages Docker for easy deployment of multiple server instances and includes a command-line interface for managing configurations.
